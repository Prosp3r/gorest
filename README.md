# Tideland Go REST Server Library

## Description

The *Tideland Go REST Server Library* helps developing RESTful server
systems. It provides a convenient mapping of URL to handlers and methods
specific to the called HTTP method. Additionally there are helpers for
marshalling and unmarshalling.

The library earlier has been known as `web` package of the
[Tideland Go Library](https://github.com/tideland/golib).

I hope you like it. ;)
